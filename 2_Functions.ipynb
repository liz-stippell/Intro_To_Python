    "# 2. Libraries and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python <b>libraries</b> (sometimes referred to as <i>packages</i>) are truly what make Python so useful. Because Python is free and open-source, anyone can make a Python library. Libraries consist of predefined functions and other capabilities. There are a few main libraries that we will discuss briefly here:\n",
    "\n",
    "`math`: This library is built into Python itself, so you do not need to install it. It has various helpful features, such as a defined value for pi, as well as predefined functions for sine, cosine, tangent, etc. (`sin()`, `cos()`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy`: This is a NUMerical PYthon library, which has similar features as the `math` library, and many more. Numpy is one of the most commonly used libraries due to its extensive functionalities. We will discuss this one more in detail later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "`scipy`: This is a SCIentific PYthon library, and has similar functions like `math` and `numpy`. Similarly, we will discuss this package in detail later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib`: This is a plotting library that allows us to make graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>To install a Python package</b>, we can do this in the command line. (You can search \"terminal\" on either Windows or Mac and it should pop up. It's a black screen.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To install any package, run `pip install [package]` (for example, `pip install numpy`) in the command line. If it asks you for a yes/no input (usually y/n), say yes\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Windows</b>: For more information, click [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-numpy-on-windows/) for understanding how to install `numpy` (other packages can be installed similarly)\n",
    "- <b>Mac</b>: For more information, click [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/install-numpy-macos/) for understanding how to install `numpy` (other packages can be installed similarly)\n",
    "\n",
    "To `import` a package (load it into Jupyter Notebook), we can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import math as math`\n",
    "\n",
    "What this is saying is that we are importing the `math` library, and we are calling it `math`. So, whenever we use a predefined function or variable, it will look like `math.[name]`. Like we said previously, the `math` library has a predefined value for pi. We can call upon this value by doing `math.pi`.\n",

Say you have `x` equal to one number, then later down in your code you redefine `x` as a different number. This will change the value of `x`. Let's show how this works: "
